# CustomerManagementSolution

#### TODO.
- Adding Controller Unit Tests(Adding unit tests for inbuild model validation)
- Adding Repository Unit Tests after removing transactions as in-memory db does not support transactions
- Caching
- Add filter options to GetAllAsync end point
- Not having seperate projects for DTOs, Entities etc (Used seperate folders instead to keep the code clean and responsibility wise seperated.)
- Included more properties for Customer with relevant validations
- Api versioning

# CustomerManagementSolution

#### Following were not implemented due to the imposed time restriction of 1 - 2 hours.
- Adding Unit Tests
- Caching
- Used a List as the Data layer
- Not having seperate projects for DTOs, Entities etc (Used seperate folders instead to keep the code clean and responsibility wise seperated.)
- Included only 3 properties for Customer with relevant validations(Name, Email, Address)
- Api versioning
